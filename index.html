        <p class="desc">Hi I’m Junghye! I’m a proud Dartmouth graduate with a degree in Quantitative Social Science which means I literally spent four years trying to understand what makes humans do what they do. My favorite classes include multivariable calculus (weird, I know), game theory, econometrics, and computational text analysis. Other relevant coursework includes linear algebra, political survey research, programming and computation, multivariate analysis, and data visualization. The following are examples of some of my coursework. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Seoul, South Korea for a semester where I studied comparative politics. When not in the library, you could find me on the golf course, taking a walk around Occum pond, or lounging on the green with my friends. The following are some examples of my coursework. </p>

          <h3>Working Paper: Context and Credibility on Social Media: Platform and News Feed Spillover Effects on Perceived Information Credibility and Engagement Behavior</h3>
          <p class="desc">
          This paper is the culmination of a term long class titled Experiments in Politics. As a class, we synthesized academic research on the topic, developed an experiment to test the effects of fake news on other news within a newsfeed, put the experiment into the field, collected results, analyzed those results, and presented them in this paper intended for publication. </p>

          <p class="desc"> Beyond the classroom, I have conducted research in both the government and economics departments studying topics such as electoral engagement in college students to African migration patterns. I also spent over 3 years as a Learning Fellow for Dartmouth’s Intro Calculus course. During this time, I worked with students in and out of the classroom to help them with course material and participated in weekly meetings to help professors identify what the students were struggling with. This experience has been integral in my work as a data analyst as it taught me how to effectively communicate complex, quantitative concepts to a range of audiences as well as the importance of tailoring your explanation to meet the audience where they are with their expertise. </p>

        <p class="desc">This was my first experience using real world data to provide insights for clients. I’m grateful that my time here allowed me to interact with nonprofits, political campaigns, and for-profit corporations because it gave me the chance to work with all the types of data- every structure, every level of cleanliness, and even some screenshots of Excel sheets. Through this, I was able to grow my box of data cleaning tools which has proven incredibly helpful to this day.
	         <br>Additionally, this internship allowed me to combine the statistical skills I had learned in my classes with the communication skills I had learned as a Learning Fellow. I found that putting myself in clients’ shoes to understand what metrics and explanations would help them make the best decisions was quite similar to putting myself in student’s shoes when I’m trying to explain limits and derivatives to them.
	          <br>Lastly, this position taught me the importance of being able to zoom in and out as a data analyst. Sometimes, I would find myself stuck on a problem and an hour and seventeen work arounds later, I would have a half solution. I quickly learned that I was getting rabbit holed with these problems and that if only I had been able to zoom out and remember the bigger picture of the analysis, I would have realized that there were other alternatives that could work. This was something that I had yet to learn in the classroom and proved to be an essential skill for my future analyses.

        <p class="desc">While 270 gave me a breadth of clients, Glossier gave me a deep look into the role data plays at an ever growing, direct to consumer, e-commerce brand. During my internship, I learned about a data team’s responsibility in advocating for a data driven culture, worked heavily with the Customer Experience and Logistics teams, and went from Looker novice to pro in just ten weeks.
        	<br>In working with the CX and logistics teams, I had the opportunity to collaborate and what KPIs would be the most helpful to each team. Then, I would come up with how we would measure them using techniques such as A/B testing, propensity score matching, and probability models. For example, I collaborated with both teams to figure out how utilize Kustomer data associating product issues with order numbers into our data warehouse so this data could be analyzed. In addition to working with these teams, I helped hold company-wide Looker Office Hours to help all teams troubleshoot issues they were having with their Looker dashboards. Before my internship, I had experience with Tableau and SQL which was quite helpful in learning Looker very quickly. Furthermore, these office hours gave me the chance to further my Looker knowledge at a much faster pace while also helping other teams.
        	<br>Glossier allowed me to see my analyses materialize into business decisions which I found incredibly exciting and helped me understand the big picture role of data in a company while also building on my technical skills and challenging me to solve new problems.

        <p class="desc">Throughout my internships and my classes, I’ve been obsessed with answering the question: why do people do what they do. Whether that be voting or clicking or purchasing one thing over another, using number to understand these choices more deeply is incredibly exciting to me. In searching for an answer to this question in dataset after dataset, there is a commonality that stands out: as humans, there are more characteristics we share than we do not. Despite today’s political climate, we could not run the analyses we do if there were not these common threads in how humans act and react. I feel passionate about Away because I believe that having the privilege to travel this globe is the greatest reminder of this fact. Given the sum of my professional and academic experiences, the opportunity to help more people realize this through smarter luggage is one I know that I would take full advantage of, and I believe that I could be an asset to Away. </p>
